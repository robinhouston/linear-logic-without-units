% The braids package provides a concise notation for drawing braid diagrams
% of the sort that appear in Section 4.2 of _Linear Logic without Units_.

% It is pretty flexible and powerful, albeit scarcely documented. There
% are plenty of examples in some-coherence.tex, on the other hand!


% The basics, in case it isn't obvious from this example:
%  - \c is a straight line
%  - \s is a crossing
%  - \f is a circle
%  - \t is a triangle


% This is to verify that, if a command such as \s is defined out here, this definition
% will not interfere with or be interfered with by the local definition inside
% the \begin{braid} ... \end{braid} block.
\newcommand\s{And indeed our \textbackslash s command is still defined afterwards!}
