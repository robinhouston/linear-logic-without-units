This is my 2007 PhD thesis *Linear Logic Without Units*. I thought it would
be interesting to publish the full source, especially since the university
web page where the PDF was hosted has been taken down.

If you want to compile it but you donâ€™t have Minion Pro, then you can add
the `nominion` option to the documentclass:

    \documentclass[12pt,nominion]{robinthesis}

The `braids.sty` package might be independently useful: look at `braid-examples.tex`
for a simple example of how to use it.
