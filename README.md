This is my 2007 PhD thesis *Linear Logic Without Units*. I thought it would
be interesting to publish the full source, especially since the university
web page where the PDF was hosted has been taken down.

I am hoping to get the source tidied up enough that it can be submitted to
the arXiv. Iâ€™ll probably have to change it to use a non-proprietary font
before I can do that, though: at the moment I do not have rights to all the
files needed to build it.
