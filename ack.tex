\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

I am indebted to many people for interesting and informative
discussions over the past four years. There follows a list of some
of the people who have
influenced my thinking in varied and often immeasurable ways -- in some cases
through just one or two conversations, and in others through repeated
contact or protracted corespondence. I apologise to
all those whose names I have mistakenly omitted. Thanks, then
(without, as the lawyers say, prejudice to the generality) to
John Baez,
Eugenia Cheng,
Robin Cockett,
Jeff Egger,
Marcelo Fiore,
Nicola Gambino,
Richard Garner,
Martin Hyland,
Achim Jung,
Joachim Kock,
Tom Leinster,
Don MacInnes,
Craig Pastro,
John Power,
Luigi Santocanale,
Peter Selinger,
Harold Simmons,
Paul Taylor,
Todd Trimble,
and
Glynn Winskel.

A particular debt is owed to Dominic Hughes, who set me on the road
that led to this thesis by innocently asking what the definition of
`unitless star-aut\-on\-om\-ous category' should be; and without whose
unceasing encouragement and boundless optimism this work would
never have reached the stage that it has.

I am also deeply indebted to Andrea Schalk, an unfailingly helpful and
supportive supervisor whose seemingly inexhaustible patience I must
have severely tested at times.

My friends and family have helped in more ways than I
could list, and this thesis would not exist without them.
