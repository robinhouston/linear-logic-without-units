A record of changes, by day, starting 15th March (when I had the idea of keeping such a log).

Thursday 2007-03-15
	- Split Monoidal Bicategories into two: Bicategories & Monoidal Bicategories.
	- Changes to Bicategories:
		o Say more about pasting diagrams
		o Add a section on mates
	
	(Motivation: I want to talk about the duality in the definition of
	braiding for a monoidal bicategory, which is easier to do if the
	language of mates is available.)

Friday 2007-03-16
	- minor corrections to Bicategories
	- add a verification that $\psi$ is a functor to the proof of Yoneda.
	- consistently write horizontal composition as \o.
	- rewrite the section on adjoint pseudo-nats in the language of mates.
	- expand the proof of the general characterisation of adjunctions
	  (because I had trouble understanding it when I reread it, and I
	  wrote it!)
* Backup 2007-03-16 taken at this point *
    - a few more minor corrections, largely to Prop. 26, which characterises
	  adjunctions in a bicategory.

Saturday 2007-03-17
	- in the definition of braiding for monoidal bicategory, remove four
	  redundant unit axioms. Indicate how they can be derived from the
	  others.
	- add discussion of duality (in terms of mates) to definition of
	  braided monoidal bicategory.
	- mention duality in definition of braided pseudomonoid.
	- Pseudomonoids =~ s/S(_\{[^|}]*\})/s$1/g
	
Sunday 2007-03-18
	- Insert some discussion of string diagrams,
	- Describe adjunctions and mates in string diagram terms,
	
	(I need the next point for the duality of braiding, and the string
	diagrams are needed to give a comprehensible proof of it!)

Monday 2007-03-19
	- Prove that, for an invertible 2-cell f => f' with f and f' equivalences,
	  the left and right mates coincide.
	- Implemement external (i.e. inter-chapter) references.
	- Flesh out the discussion of braiding duality, using the new tools.

Tuesday 2007-03-20
	- Complete Pseudomonoids chapter (at last!)

Wednesday 2007-03-21
	- Start on Cayley's theorem: explain how it works for monoids.
		o Internal Cayley Theorem
		o start on External Cayley Theorem

Thursday2007-03-22
	- Remove some irrelevant material (on $phi_X$ itself being a map of modules),
	  and replace with a short remark to that effect.
	- Remove some (hopefully) unneeded remarks about coherence.
	- Explain necessary background for external theorem.

Friday 2007-03-23
	(Travelling to Nice today. Not so much time to work on the computer: constrained
	by battery life!)
	- Finish proof of External Cayley in the monoid case.

[ In Nice attending PSSL 85 - away from thesis - and then reassembling thoughts
  and thinking about the semi SMCC chapter ]

[ Changelog now maintained -- not entirely reliably -- in SVN ]
